# Crypto

My inspiration was Coinbase and I wanted to build a site to track the top cryptos and to be able add the ones I want to my own watchlist. Each user can have their own watch list when signing in.  




## Live Website

https://crypto-b96fd.firebaseapp.com/signup
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Hagen-Fulford/crypto_site
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```

Note you will need to install firebase and obtain your own credentials. 


## Tech Stack

React, Axios, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, NPM
